# Teamcity Python API wrapper

## What is it?
Yet another Teamcity API wrapper.

Inspired by [atlassian-python-api](https://github.com/atlassian-api/atlassian-python-api)

The main goal of this library is to provide a simple but powerful tool for TeamCity API.

It will provide you the raw output, without any confusing object mapping or something. Just pure JSON/XML to work with.
